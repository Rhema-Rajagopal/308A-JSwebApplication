The Single Page Application (SPA) allows users to search for meals based on ingredients, fetching data from an external API asynchronously using JavaScript's Promises and async/await syntax. Utilizing event listeners, the application responds to both button clicks and keyboard events, enhancing user experience. The JavaScript Event Loop efficiently manages asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth execution and timely rendering of search results. Organized with modular JavaScript and ES6 imports, the SPA showcases modern development practices for a robust web application.
